yazgoowm is a minimalistic X window manager based on tinywm and tailored just for me.

design goals and features:
  - kiss: only window management (no taskbar, ...), complex stuff should be done using other programs (rofi, ...)
  - less than 200 LOC
  - tiled
  - configuration as code (like qtile, dwm)
  - worspaces
